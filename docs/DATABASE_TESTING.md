# üîß Database Testing & Sample Data Guide

This guide will help you test your database connection and populate it with realistic sample data for development and testing.

## üéØ Quick Start

### Method 1: Using the Web Interface (Recommended)

1. **Start the development server:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Database Test page:**
   - Open your browser to `http://localhost:5173`
   - Login as an admin user
   - Click on "DB Test" in the navigation menu
   - Or go directly to: `http://localhost:5173/database-test`

3. **Test and populate:**
   - Click "Test Connection" to verify Firebase connectivity
   - Click "Check Data" to see current database contents
   - Click "Seed Database" to populate with sample data

### Method 2: Using Browser Console

1. **Open your browser's developer console** (F12)

2. **Use the available functions:**
   ```javascript
   // Test database connection
   await testDB()
   
   // Check existing data
   await checkData()
   
   // Seed database (only if empty)
   await seedDB()
   
   // Force seed (add data even if exists)
   await seedDB(true)
   ```

## üîç Testing Database Connection

### Common Issues and Solutions

1. **"Database connection failed"**
   - Check your Firebase environment variables
   - Ensure your Firebase project is active
   - Verify Firestore is enabled in your Firebase console

2. **"Permission denied"**
   - Check your Firestore security rules
   - Ensure your user has proper authentication

3. **"Module not found" errors**
   - Run `npm install` to ensure all dependencies are installed
   - Check that axios is installed: `npm install axios`

### Environment Variables Required

Make sure these are set in your `.env` file:
```
VITE_FIREBASE_API_KEY=your_api_key
VITE_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=your_project.firebaseapp.com
VITE_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your_project_id
VITE_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=your_project.appspot.com
VITE_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=your_sender_id
VITE_FIREBASE_APP_ID=your_app_id
VITE_OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_key (optional, for AI features)
```

## üöÄ Advanced Usage

### Seeding Options

```javascript
// Basic seeding (only if database is empty)
await seedDB()

// Force seeding (adds data regardless)
await seedDB(true)

// Check what's in the database
const data = await checkData()
console.log(`Candidates: ${data.candidates}, Jobs: ${data.jobs}`)
```

### Custom Data

You can modify the sample data in `frontend/src/scripts/seedDatabase.ts`:
- Edit `sampleCandidates` array to add/modify candidate profiles
- Edit `sampleJobs` array to add/modify job postings
- Adjust application creation logic in `seedApplications` function

## üìà Verifying Success

After seeding, you should see:

1. **In the Database Test page:**
   - Connection status: "Database Connected"
   - Data count showing candidates and jobs

2. **In the app:**
   - Navigate to "Candidates" page to see candidate profiles
   - Navigate to "Jobs" page to see job listings
   - Navigate to "AI Matching" to test candidate-job matching

3. **In Firebase Console:**
   - Go to your Firebase project
   - Check Firestore Database
   - You should see `candidates`, `jobs`, and `applications` collections

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

### If seeding fails:

1. **Check console errors** in browser developer tools
2. **Verify Firebase permissions** in your Firestore rules
3. **Test connection first** before attempting to seed
4. **Check network connectivity** to Firebase

### If data doesn't appear in the app:

1. **Refresh the page** to reload data
2. **Check browser console** for JavaScript errors
3. **Verify user permissions** (admin vs regular user)
4. **Test individual service functions** in console

## üîÑ Resetting Data

To clear all data and start fresh:

1. Go to Firebase Console
2. Navigate to Firestore Database
3. Delete the collections: `candidates`, `jobs`, `applications`
4. Run the seeding process again

## üìû Need Help?

If you encounter issues:

1. Check the browser console for detailed error messages
2. Verify your Firebase configuration
3. Ensure all dependencies are installed
4. Test the connection before seeding
