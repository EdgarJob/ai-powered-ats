    I need to perform a comprehensive analysis of how well a candidate matches a job position. Please evaluate all aspects including skills, experience, education, responsibilities, and industry fit.

    JOB REQUIREMENTS:
    ${requirementsList}

    JOB DESCRIPTION:
    ${jobDescription}

    CANDIDATE INFORMATION:
    Bio: ${candidateData.bio || 'Not provided'}
    Education: ${candidateData.education_level || 'Not provided'}
    
    Employment History:
    ${employmentSummary || 'None provided'}
    
    Certifications: 
    ${certificationsSummary || 'None provided'}

    Please perform a detailed analysis including:
    
    1. SKILLS MATCHING:
       - Extract specific skills mentioned in the candidate's bio and employment history
       - Compare these skills with both explicit and implicit skills required in the job description
       - Consider both technical and soft skills
    
    2. RESPONSIBILITY MATCHING:
       - Compare the candidate's past job responsibilities with the responsibilities required for this position
       - Identify similarities and gaps
    
    3. INDUSTRY EXPERIENCE:
       - Analyze if the candidate has worked in the same or related industries
       - Evaluate how transferable their industry experience is to this role
    
    4. EDUCATION RELEVANCE:
       - Assess if the candidate's education aligns with job requirements
       - Consider both formal education and professional certifications
    
    5. CERTIFICATION VALUE:
       - Evaluate how relevant the candidate's certifications are to this specific role
       - Consider certification issuer reputation and industry recognition

    Please analyze the match and provide:
    1. An overall match score as a percentage (0-100%)
    2. Specific scores for Skills (0-100%), Education (0-100%), Experience (0-100%), Industry Fit (0-100%), and Responsibility Match (0-100%)
    3. For each major job requirement, indicate if it's matched and provide a detailed reason
    
    Format your response as JSON with this structure:

      "overallScore": number,
